# see-you-outside
A visual tool to simulate the consequences of different policies adopted in releasing the lockdown 


If you have not installed python, we recommend using Anaconda

To install the web app, we suggest to create a new Python virtual environment.
You can create a new environement with the command line:
'''
conda create -n hackathon python=3.6
conda activate python
'''

 Then, from any location you want to put the files:

'''
git clone https://github.com/donlelef/see-you-outside.git
cd see-you-outside/src/python
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''

To run the app

'''
python app.py
'''
